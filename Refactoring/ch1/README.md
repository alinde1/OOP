# Chapter 1 notes

> The program may not be
broken, but it does hurt. It is making your life more difficult because you find it hard to make the
changes your users want. (p. 17)

__Extract Method__
__Move Method__
__Replace Temp with Query__

## Tips

- When you find you have to add a feature to a program, and the program's code is not
  structured in a convenient way to add the feature, first refactor the program to make it
  easy to add the feature, then add the feature.
  
- Before you start refactoring, check that you have a solid suite of tests. These tests
  must be self-checking.
  
- Refactoring changes the programs in small steps. If you make a mistake, it is easy to
  find the bug.

- Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write
  code that humans can understand.
